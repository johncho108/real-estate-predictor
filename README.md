Real Estate Predictor is a web app (built as a project for an undergraduate course) that allows users to predict real estate values based on three mandatory features (number of bedrooms, living area in sqft, and quality of construction) and up to six additional optional features (number of bathrooms, lot size (sqft), number of floors, waterfront, view, and condition). The predictive algorithm was implemented using multiple linear regression from the scikit-learn Python library. The model was trained using a data set from Kaggle (www.kaggle.com/astronautelvis/kc-house-data). Some basic visualizations were added in line with the project's requirements for the course, as well as login/logout functionality. 

The website is currently deployed at: [realestatepredict.herokuapp.com](https://realestatepredict.herokuapp.com/). To view the site, log in with username: test and password: testword1.
